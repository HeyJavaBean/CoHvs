# CoHvs
> Company of Heroes 1 Over-LANs PVP Program

Demo Version，now only supports 1v1 and many parts are still unfinished.

To play CoH with your friends in different LANs, do as the following steps:

- Server Side:
  - Get a server with a public ip (in constant.go and the default value is my server ip)
  - Execute “**./main server** ” in order to run the program in server mode.
  - Wait the client side to start.
- Client Side:
  - Execute "**./main.exe**" by simply click the exe icon or using cmd.
  - When client successfully get connection with the server, then start CoH.
  - If the client shell says "sniffer is starting", you can create a new game room, otherwise you can only join other players' room (but it's still ok to play the game).
  - Enjoy the game!
